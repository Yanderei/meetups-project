POSSIBLE ISSUES:

If there are no meetups/ a blank meetup card when starting the project:
-please create a new firebase project
-go into the build tab
-select realtime database
-ensure that you select "Start in Test Mode" so that you can send API requests

If images are not coming up on the cards:
-ensure that you copy the image address, not link address
